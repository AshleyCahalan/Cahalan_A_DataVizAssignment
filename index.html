			<h2>Canada is the BEST Team at the Winter Olympics</h2>
			<p>Over the years, Canada has proven itself to be a very strong competitor in the Winter Olympic Games year after year. One may even say Canada is the best country at the Winter Olympics! As a Canadian myself, I may be a little biased, but when you take a look at the numbers you may find yourself agreeing with this opionion, if you don't already! Take note that the data used and analyzed was the Olympic sports and medals data, provided by the IOC Research and Reference Service and published by The Guardian's Datablog, for 45 countries competing between 1924 and 2014. Let's jump right in and take a look at some reasons why Team Canada is the BEST... </p>

			<h3 class="hidden">First Reason</h3>
			<h3>FIRST OF ALL, Canada Has A LOT of Medals!</h3>
			<p>For the purposes of making this point, we will focus on the 10 countries, according to the data, with the most medals won at the Winter Olympics from 1924-2014. These include Austria (AUT), Canada (CAN), Finland (FIN), Germany (GER), Norway (NOR), Russia (RUS), Soviet Union (URS), Sweden (SWE), Switzerland (SUI) and United States of America (USA). As we can see from the graph, two countries take a significant lead in total medal count - the United States with 653 medals, and not far behind, Canada with 623 medals. </p>

			<p>Let's break it down further. This graph shows the same 10 countries, but with the number of gold medals each country has won. Though Canada may not have the MOST medals, they take the lead in GOLD medals.</p>

			<h3 class="hidden">Second Reason</h3>
			<h3>Canadian Athletes ROCK!</h3>
			<p>Both men and women athletes have added to Canada's medal count. This graph shows that for BOTH men and women, more GOLD medals than silver or bronze.</p>
			<img src="images/graph_3.png" alt="Bar Graph" class="data_img">
			<p>This graph shows the number of medals earned by gender for the 10 countries with most medals. It's exciting to see not only Canada's men up near the top in number of medals won, but also Canada's WOMEN as one of the highest earners of winter Olympic medals.</p>

			<h3 class="hidden">Third Reason</h3>
			<h3>Canada CRUSHES In These 2 Sports...</h3>
			<p>Looking at this graph, it is CLEAR Canada takes the victory in Olympic Hockey, with 376 medals, 221 of them being gold.</p>
			<img src="images/graph_5.png" alt="Bar Graph" class="data_img">
			<p>Another one of Canada's strong sports is skating. As seen in this graph, Canada takes second place in most medals won in skating, right after the United States.</p>
